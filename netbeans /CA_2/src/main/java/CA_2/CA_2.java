//CA2 Integrated Project - I chosed Bank Organisation 
// The program will allow the user to:
//read employee/applicant records from a file;
//sort records alphabetically;
//search for a person and show their manager type and department;
//add new employee records with input validation;
//create an employee hierarchy using a binary tree.
//The system will use the package name CA_2 as required in the assignment brief.

import java.util.Scanner;

//This class will starts the system and displays the menu options.

//For now, I am creating the console menu structure first later, each menu option will call a method, such as reading the file,
//sorting records, searching employees, adding records and creating the binary tree.
